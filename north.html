            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <div class="divider"></div>
            <h3>A personal matter</h3>
            <p>I’m personally more interested in the arctic areas, culture, hiking, roadtrips than going to warm places and hitting the beach. Throughout my journeys I’ve discovered that not everyone is aware of the nuances of the nordic landscape, and locals struggle dealing with the recent increase in tourism.</p>
            <p>Educating tourists from different countries, geographical areas and cultures could help easen the locals’ struggles, and create a safe and memorable (in a good way) experience for visitors.</p>
            <h3>How does it work in practice?</h3>
            <p>After observation and research, I prepare content for the website. Instead of showering visitors in general information, I encourage them to use the bucketlist app; there they can choose the places they want to visit, and get specific, practical information about the places of their choice. Such information can be do’s and dont’s (according to locals), the best time to visit, the equipment you need, the unique things you have to watch out for.</p>
            <p>The goal is to make this process exciting for visitors, so they WANT TO educate themselves about the place. Nobody likes to be lectured, but putting your bucketlist together, share it and get inspired can be exciting.</p>
            <h3>Research</h3>
            <p>It started with <strong>observation</strong>. I’ve seen the trash at Norway’s most remote and beautiful places with my own eyes. I’ve seen how shamelessly people just hide their kids’ diapers under a rock and move on with their trip. Therefore I had some assumptions that I went out to verify or disprove.</p>
            <p><strong>Competitors:</strong> I’ve found that there are lots of travel agencies organizing Nordic holidays, but I’ve also found that the use of travel agencies has been declining since the 2000s.</p>
            <p><strong>Quantitative research:</strong> Via a survey I gained more insight into holiday planning habits and interests of visitors.</p>
