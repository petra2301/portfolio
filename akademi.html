            <p>The purpose of the redesign is improving UX using the quantitative and qualitative data we gathered in the year before.</p>

          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <div class="divider"></div>
          <h3>Iteraring on the first design</h3>
          <p>Since we had a page that was already live and working, I first looked at the <strong>data</strong> we gathered in the past year. This data included <strong>CTR numbers</strong> that showed us what <strong>USPs, images</strong> and <strong>texts</strong> worked the best in advertisements.</p>
          <p>I also went through all the contact e-mails we got to figure out what people <strong>ask frequently</strong>. This gave me a good <strong>insight</strong> into what people think is important <strong>information</strong>, but don’t understand or can’t find on the webpage. I made these <strong>more obvious</strong> on the new front page.</p>
          <p>Once I had the data I needed, I made <strong>sketches</strong> to arrange the new content, that later developed into <strong>wireframes</strong> and a <strong>prototype</strong>.</p>
          <p>I also created <strong>personas</strong> to doublecheck and reinforce the importance of our USPs (please, contact me for personas).</p>
          <p>A remark about the difference in the prototype design and the finished product: we decided to use a light theme due to different usability concerns as well as better compatibility with recognizable partner logos.</p></p>

            <h3>Quantitative data from advertisements</h3>
            <p>The most effective texts and headlines were the ones that included the location, practical workshops and portfolio. The most effective headline even brought 85% of the clicks.</p>
            <p>The most effective CTA was “Learn more” – so all the buttons have “Learn more” on them now </p>
            <h3>Qualitative data from people</h3>
            <p>The most common things people asked about:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>when and where the courses are</li>
                <li>if previous experience is required</li>
                <li>general confusion if it’s an online course, or an evening course</li>

            <div class="divider"></div>
            <h3>Imagery</h3>
            <p>According to our data, images with code speak to our target audience, therefore we choose a banner where code is visible, but it's homogeneous enough to be the background for our hero text.</p>

                  <div id="collapseImagery" class="accordion-collapse collapse show" aria-labelledby="imageryHeading" data-bs-parent="#imagery">
                    <div class="accordion-body">
                        <p>Our old slogan was “Learn full-stack programming from scratch in one year by experts”.</p>
                        <p>Many asked if they could take the front-end and back-end courses separately, due to time and money problems. We concluded that 1 year is too big of a commitment, so we reduced the course’s price, and its length to 6 months, and made the two parts available separately.</p>
                        <p><strong>Competitor analysis</strong> also revealed that <strong>live mentoring</strong> is our <strong>strongest unique selling point</strong> (USP) compared to online tutorial sites like, Freecodecamp, Udemy or Udacity. Therefore it is also included in the new slogan.</p>
                        <p>Our new slogan is “Full-stack programming course in Oslo with live mentoring”.</p>

                <h3>Getting to the point</h3>
                <p>I moved parts of the intro section to an “About us” page in order to <strong>display the courses withing fewer scrolls</strong>. I did this because I assume people are initially more interested in what solution we have for their problems, rather than who we are.</p>
                <p>I also changed the button text from “Read more” to <strong>“Learn more”</strong>, because that’s what <strong>performed best</strong> in the advertisements.</p>

                <h3>Emphasized USPs & readability</h3>
                <p>In order to improve readability I divided the text into smaller bits, and added headings that included our <strong>well-performing USPs</strong> and things  e-mails frequently asked about.</p>
                <p>These keywords are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>portfolio</li>
                    <li>weekend courses</li>
                    <li>in Oslo</li>
                    <li>for beginners</li>
                </ul>
                <p>People kept mistaking the blue words for links, so we used orange for highlighting instead.</p>

                <div class="col-md-6 mb-3">
                    <h4>Original</h4>
                    <img src="assets/img/akademi-readability-before.jpg" alt="readability before" class="w-100">

                </div>

                <h3>Other interesting results</h3>
                <p>Initially I chose a quite artistic picture of Oslo to represent the location, but testers said that there was a high chance <strong>users are not be familiar</strong> with this view at all.</p>
                <p>Therefore I chose a more casual image, something visitors and Oslo-ers would see every day: the Rådhus It is represented in our logo, and it makes users recognize the place before they read anything. </p>
